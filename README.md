# planet-bitfolk
Configuration for Planet BitFolk and associated projects.

## Purpose
[Planet BitFolk](https://planet.bitfolk.com/) is a feed aggregator. It
publishes feeds of articles and updates by BitFolk, its customers and
hangers-on.

## Adding your feed

### Whose feeds are welcome
Generally, if you are a customer or someone active in and around BitFolk then
you may add your feed. If you cease to be active then we'd like you to remove
it again, or we might do that for you, if we notice that we haven't seen you
around in a long time.

### How to add your feed
In decreasing order of preference:
* Edit the
  [config.ini](https://github.com/bitfolk/planet-bitfolk/blob/main/config.ini)
  here in this repository and submit a pull request.
* Or open an issue asking to be added.
* Or find some way to contact @grifferz and ask him to add you.

We prefer feeds that give the full content of your articles (not just a
synopsis / first paragraph), but if you really don't want to show the full
article then that's okay. Discoverability is the main thing.

Please add your feed in alphabetical order (by the `name` parameter).

## Content guide
Content doesn't have to be about BitFolk or technical in nature.

Please consider a diverse readership and try not to be annoying. If you are
excessively annoying (in the sole determination of BitFolk) then you may be
asked to provide a tagged feed without such posts, or else have your feed
removed.

Your feed should be in English.

Advertising content (as distinct from just posts about what you're working on
etc.) is not welcome.

Please only add *your own* feeds, not those of anyone else.
